I'm developing this project because the existing
ChinaDNS occasionally behaves wierd, so I would rather write one by
myself. I'm using Haskell because of:
- high concurrency
- static type safety
- efficient development

* Overview
This program assumes:
- access to the TCP port 53 on the foreign DNS is proxy-ed(ss-redir, VPN,
  etc.), or you will still be poisoned.
- this proxy has to be the same host you use to proxy other traffic
  (http, etc.), otherwise we couldn't guarantee a CDN-optimal
  result.

The built-in resolution strategy:
1. On receiving a request, check if the request is for a foreign
   domain(=--world_name=). yes: go to 2; no: go to 3;
2. Forward the request to foreign DNS and wait for the result.
3. Forward the request to Chinese and foreign DNS at the same time.
   Check if the response from Chinese DNS contains foreign
   IP(=--china_ip=). yes: go to 4; no: go to 5;
4. wait for response from foreign DNS
5. return Chinese result immediately.

*Note: only TCP is used for foreign DNS.*

If you have any thoughts about the resolution strategy, please feel
free to share it on the issue page.

* Configuration
#+Begin_example
  Usage: zhina-dns [--host HOST] [--port PORT] [--zhina_host HOST]
                   [--zhina_port PORT] [--world_host HOST] [--world_port PORT]
                   [--zhina_timeout MICROSEC] [--world_timeout MICROSEC]
                   [--log_level SPEC] --zhina_ip PATH --world_name PATH
    a DNS proxy for people in Zhina

  Available options:
    -h,--help                Show this help text
    --host HOST              hostname to bind (default: Nothing)
    --port PORT              port number to bind (default: "5300")
    --zhina_host HOST        upstream Chinese server
                             host (default: "114.114.114.114")
    --zhina_port PORT        upstream Chinese server port (default: "53")
    --world_host HOST        upstream foreign server host (default: "8.8.8.8")
    --world_port PORT        upstream foreign server port (default: "53")
    --zhina_timeout MICROSEC timeout for Chinese upstream, UDP and TCP
                             combined (default: 1000000)
    --world_timeout MICROSEC timeout for foreign upstream, UDP and TCP
                             combined (default: 5000000)
    --log_level SPEC         spec for logging (default: [("",INFO)])
    --zhina_ip PATH          file containing Chinese IP ranges
    --world_name PATH        file containing foreign domain names

Please fork this repository for more fine-grained modifications; feel
free to drop a pull request if you think your modifications may be also
useful to others.
- for modifications of upstream servers/local servers, see [[src/Main.hs]]
- for modifications of the resolution strategy, see [[src/ZhinaDNS.hs]]

* Running
This program needs a list of Chinese IP ranges and a list of
foreign domain names on startup. The formats of both are similar and
is as follows:
#+begin_example
  # this is allowed
    # this is also allowed
     
  #^ empty line (with or without spaces) is allowed
  #v ip range prefixed or suffixed with spaces is allowed
     1.0.1.0/24
  #v single ip    address is also allowed
   127.0.0.1
#+end_example

Both files are shipped with the project already: check out [[china.txt]]
and [[world.txt]]. However, if you prefer generating these files yourself,
please check out [[china.awk]] (for =china.txt=) and
[[https://github.com/cokebar/gfwlist2dnsmasq]] (for =world.txt=).

And we are free to go:
#+begin_src sh
./zhina-dns --zhina_ip china.txt --world_name world.txt
#+end_src

Since every request to =zhina-dns= involves a request to the foreign
DNS(if it's a foreign website), the latency may be quite high(as
high as 300ms), it's thus *strongly recommended* to wrap a layer of
=pdnsd= or =unbound= as DNS cache. I had some problems with =pdnsd=, so
=unbound= maybe better. An example of =unbound.conf=: 

#+begin_src yaml
server:
  verbosity: 3
  interface: 127.0.0.1
  use-syslog: yes
  username: "unbound"
  directory: "/etc/unbound"
  do-not-query-localhost: no
  
forward-zone:
  name: "."
  forward-addr: 127.0.0.1@5300
#+end_src
=do-not-query-localhost: no= overrides the restriction of =unbound= that
local servers can't be used as upstream server.
